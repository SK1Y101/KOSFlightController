# KOSFlightController
My detail flight controller for the Kerbal Space Program Mod "Kerbal Operating System", designed for my Realism Overhaul Save

## What does it do?
As of version 0.15, not a lot!

It will boot on load, and install a simple interface.
This interface will launch whenever the craft does not have access to the KSC, and shows various levels of information.
The flight computer will choose the largest UI that will fit into the spacecraft's local volume.
